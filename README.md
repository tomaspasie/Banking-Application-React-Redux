Project Requirements:

Code In Github ✔
Deployed On Server ✔
Responsive Pages ✔
Styling ✔

Displays all accounts and current balance ✔
Accounts retrived from API and stored in Redux ✔
Keep a record of all transactions for each account on a transactions page ✔
On account page, display information, balance, and transaction history ✔
On account page, retrieve ID from URL ✔
On account page, add button to delete and edit account ✔
On account page, add ability to deposit and withdraw money with each transaction being recorded and updated balance being displayed ✔

Notes:
• MobileVariablePage.js works and displays fine locally but I found that it does not display correctly in the deplyed website.
• The variable pages (VariablePage.js and MobileVariablePage.js) seem not display the updated name and balance because I'm not calling from the redux state. I had to set Line 112 and Line 113 to get the value from this.state because I was getting undefined variables when trying to access specific values in the redux state in the variable pages despite being able to access it as a whole. I spent many hours trying to fix this but ultimatly could not find a solution.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
